# Australian Residential Rental Prices, Vacancies, Vacancy Rates and Price Rate Differences
 A study of Australian residential rental prices, vacancies, vacancy rates and price rate differences between February 2021 and February 2022. 
 
 ## Overview
 The premise of this study was to investigate the rental price, total number, percentage and trends in Australian residential rental vacancies over a 12-month period between <b>February 2021 and February 2022</b>.
 
 ## Analysis
 ### Price
 
 Over the 12-month period, there was a general trend in the rise of residential rental prices across all capital cities.

</p>
 
 Bucking this trend was <b>Melbourne</b> and <b>Hobart</b>, where rental prices for units <b>fell 2.6%</b> and <b>0.3%</b>, respectively. 
 
 Of the cities which observed a rise in rental prices, <b>Darwin</b> experienced the greatest combined rental price increase, with a total increase of <b>35.6%</b> – <b>10.9% for houses</b> and <b>24.7% for units.</b>
 
### Vacancies
#### State

Across this period, there was a also a mostly-negative trend in the total number of rental vacancies.

</p>

During this period, <b>Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Canberra and Hobart</b> each experienced a <b>negative trend</b> in rental vacancies, with each city recording <b>fewer</b> total rental vacancies.

Although <b>Perth</b> also experienced a similar trend between the <b>11-month period of February 2021 – January 2022,</b> the city experienced an <b>increase in the total number of rental vacancies over a 1-month period into February 2022.</b>

Conversely, <b>Darwin experienced an opposite trend</b> – with the number of residential rental vacancies <b>increasing (albeit slightly)</b> over the February 2021 – February 2022 time period. 

#### National

This negative trend in the total number of residential rental vacancies available across this period was also experienced <b>nationally.</b>

### Vacancy Rate

In line with the trends outlined in the previous charts, <b>all capital cities</b> experienced a downward trend in the residential rental vacancy rate, meaning <b>fewer and fewer residential properties became available for tenants during this time.</b>

</p>

Conversely, <b>Darwin</b> was the exception – with the city experiencing an <b>increase</b> in the number of residential properties available for rent during <b>January 2021,</b> and <b>returning to previous rates in February 2022.</b> 

As outlined in the chart above, this trend was also experienced <b>nationally.</b>

### Price Difference

The figure below demonstrates the <b>drastic increase and difference of rental prices</b> in Metro and Non-Metro (regional) areas across the country over the past two years.

</p>

The figure shows residents in <b>Non-Metro</b> areas have experienced rental prices going up by as much as <b>3x</b> their original amount in 2019.

It should also be noted that this <b>threefold rental increase</b> has occurred <b>while the same increase in wages has not.</b> 

## Summary

* Residential rental prices have <b>increased</b> substantially over the <b>February 2021 – February 2022</b> period, with the exception of <b>Melbourne and Hobart unit prices.</b>
 * Nationally, the number of available residential properties for rent continues to <b>decline.</b>
 * In 2022, <b>Melbourne</b> continues to have the most residential properties available for rent, with <b>Hobart</b> having the least.
